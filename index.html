        <p>Dear friend,<br>How are you today? I hope you are having the most perfect day bud. I just wanted to thank you, for literally everything you've done so far for me, and for all the support you gave to me, and for all the joy you brought into my life, to be honest I am so grateful for every single second we spent together man. You are the real defination for friendship. No matter what I do, I could never repay you for all the things you've done for me. You may see them as tiny things but for me, they are everything.<br>I'll try to get my bike fixed as soon as possible and I hope you I haven't bothered you with all of my requests.<br><br>Your closest friend, Snowy.</p>
